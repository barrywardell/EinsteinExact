EinsteinExact is an arrangement of Cactus thorns which provide exact solutions
of Einstein's equations.
===============================================================================


Getting the arrangement
-----------------------
The latest version of EinsteinExactwill always be available from the project
git repository:

git clone --recursive git://github.com/barrywardell/EinsteinExact

Requirements
------------
The EinsteinExact thorns are designed to work with Cactus as part of the
EinsteinToolkit. All requirements are therefore already included with the
EinsteinToolkit.

Installation
------------
The generated code for the thorns is provided in the master_thorns branch.
Check this branch out into your Cactus arrangements directory.

To regenerate the code, checkout the master branch and run 'make' from
within the checkout.
